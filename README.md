# PONGüèì

This is a simple recreation of the classic **PONG** game, developed as one of my first Python projects!  As part of my journey learning Python, I used the **Pygame** library to implement this game and gain hands-on experience with game development.

## Features 
- **Two-player mode**: Compete against a friend with one player controlling each paddle.
- **Ball physics**: Smooth and realistic ball movement.
- **Score tracking**: Keep track of each player's points.

## What I Learned
- Working with **Pygame** to create graphics, handle events, and manage game loops.
- Basics of **object-oriented programming** in Python for organising game elements.
- Implementing basic **game mechanics** like scoring and paddle movement.

## How to play
- Clone this repository.
- Install [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).
- Run `python game_manager.py` from the project root directory.
